    First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull
request. If you have any questions, please let us know.

You will need to sign a Contributer's License Agreement (CLA) the first time you submit a pull request and anytime afterwards that the CLA agreement is updated (very rarely). This is signed by clicking on the request as part of the pull request and digitally signed with your Github ID automatically.
